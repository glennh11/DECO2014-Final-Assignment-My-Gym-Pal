### Project title: My Gym Pal

## Description: 
My Gym Pal is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to generate a gym routine and program based on the days they are available to train. The applications main purpose is to provide a user a gym program and track their personal-records in each specific exercise they are given. It's build using HTML and JavaScript, and uses localStorage for data persistence. 


## Version Control:
This project uses git and github for managing new developments and track any changes made during the progression of the project. 

See the github repository here: 


## Features:
- **Initial Survey**: This initial survey determines the best gym program for the user to follow based on how many days there are available to complete weights training. 

- **Gym Program**: Dependent on the days, the application will provide a gym program. For example, if the user is free 6 days a week, they will be given a push/pull/legs gym split, if the user is free for only 3 days, they will be given a full body split. 

- **Exercise progression**: The application will track via localStorage the best weight lifted for each exercise the user completes and stores it in the "My Journey" section of the web application. 

- **Data Persistence**: The application uses localStorage to store the maximum weight and personal record a user completes. When the user refreshes the page and or closes and reopens the browser, the application will still display the user PR's.


## Setup
No setup is required. 


## Usage
Two options to use the web applciation:
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser
2. Open the folder on VS Code and use the Live Server extension to run the website

Once the page is open, fill out the initial survey. As soon as you click continue your newly generated gym program will be available. You can check which days have what exercises and freely input what weight you completed for each set of the exercise. 


## Limitations
The application uses localStorage to store data, therefore it is limited to the device and browser it is initially used in. If the application is opened on a different browser or device, the user's PR's aren't available there. 


## Notes
I understand and acknowledge the need to use gitHub throughout the progression of the assignment. I did not realise this which I take full responsibility of. My gitHub Repository demonstrates my efforts to include all the changes I made previously to the best of my memory.
