Project title: My Gym Pal

Description: A fitness web-app for gym users to generate a gym routine based on their lifestyle. This app initially begins with a survey, where users enter their age, gender, work out availabilities etc. Based on these responses, the web app will generate a workout program that the user can follow. 

The users are also able to input how much weight they have lifted for each exercise which will be logged and display their personal best in a section called My Journey.
