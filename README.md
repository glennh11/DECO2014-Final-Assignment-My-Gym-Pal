Project title: My Gym Pal

Description: A fitness web-app for gym users to generate a gym routine based on their lifestyle. This app initially begins with a survey, where users enter their age, gender, work out availabilities etc. Based on these responses, the web app will generate a workout program that the user can follow. 

The users are also able to input how much weight they have lifted for each exercise which will be logged and display their personal best in a section called My Journey. 

NOTES: 
- I understand the marking criteria includes the "Use of version control and GitHub for code repository hosting, with a thorough and well-organized commit history that reflects a high level of professionalism and attention to detail." I take full responsibility of not using GitHub for code repository hosting and demonstrating version control earlier. Apologies for any inconveniences and my inability to demonstrate a professional level of commit history.
